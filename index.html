      <h1>Callbacks and Scoping with Python and Javascript <small>by Julian Ceipek</small></h1>

      <h2>Why Should I Care?</h2>
      <p>GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) are pretty cool. They make applications look 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)#Signature_show_elements">shiny</a>,
      they let ordinary mortals play with our code, and (depending on who you ask) they're a lot more fun 
      than command line programs.</p>

      <p>Here's where the trouble comes in. When you're writing a GUI application, you need to provide the user with
      choices:</p>

      <div class="well">
        <img src="img/MapMenu.png" alt="GUI Example">
        <div class="fig">The Marauder's Map@Olin: GUIs are interactive!</div>
      </div>

      <p>How might we go about creating this interactivity? Well, we might imagine having a function
      <code>button_clicked(the_button)</code> that does something based on which button is clicked:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
# Make Some Buttons

...

def button_clicked(the_button):
    if the_button == "Open Map":
        # Do Lots Of Stuff
    elif the_button == "Refresh My Location":
        # Do Some Other Stuff
    elif the_button == "Correct My Location":
        # And Even More Stuff
    ...

def event_loop():
    # When a button is clicked, call button_clicked with the appropriate string

    ...</pre>

      <p>This might work well enough for simple programs with a few buttons, but as you can probably tell, 
      this can get long and ugly very quickly, especially when you are working on a project collaboratively. 
      Most GUI frameworks provide a neater, more event-based way of dealing with user actions with <em>callbacks</em>.</p>

      <h2>
      Callbacks
      <small>Responding to Events</small>
      </h2>

      <p>The premise of a callback is pretty easy to understand. When some <em>event</em> happens, perform some <em>action</em>
      by calling a function. To get this to work, we can <em>register</em> functions with events.</p>

      <p>In <a href="http://www.pyside.org/"><em>PySide</em></a>, a pythonic wrapper for the modern GUI framework 
      <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/"><em>QT</em></a>, the code we wrote above can be rewritten in the following way:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
class DemoWindow(QtGui.QDialog):
    def create_buttons(self):
        self.open_button = QtGui.QAction("Open Map", self, triggered = self.open_webapp)
        self.refresh_button = QtGui.QAction("Refresh My Location", self, triggered=self.initiate_location_refresh)
        self.correct_location_button = QtGui.QAction("Correct My Location", self, triggered=self.correct_location)
        ...
    
    def open_webapp(self):
        # Do Lots Of Stuff

    def initiate_location_refresh(self):
        # Do Some Other Stuff

    def correct_location(self):
        # And Even More Stuff
    ...</pre>

        <div class="alert">
          <strong>Note:</strong> This code is a simplified and adapted excerpt from the 
          <a href="https://github.com/ohack/maraudersmap-client">Marauder's Map@Olin</a>; 
          it won't run if you paste it into a python shell.
        </div>

        <p>Without going too far into the details of how <a href="http://www.pyside.org/"><em>PySide</em></a> works, 
        the <code>triggered</code> keyword argument for the <code>QtGui.QAction</code> constructor specifies the function
        that will be executed when the button is clicked. For example, line 3 in the code example above sets the behavior of
        the "Open Map" button to call the <code>open_webapp</code> function.</p>

        <span class="label label-info">Heads up!</span> There's an important difference between <code>a_function</code> and
        <code>a_function()</code> in languages like Python and JavaScript. The former is a <em>function object</em> while the latter
        executes the function. The ability to pass around function objects like this makes creating callbacks really easy in Python 
        and JavaScript.

    Try running each of the following lines in a python shell. Make sure you understand what is going on before skipping 
    to the next section.

        <h2>
        Dynamic Callbacks 
        <small>Down the Rabbit Hole with Variable Scope</small>
        </h2>

        <p>Callbacks are great for static buttons you define manually, but how do you use them with dynamic buttons
        with different behaviors? A simple example might be a "Correct My Location" feature that lets the user choose
        his or her location from a dropdown menu:</p>

        <div class="well">
          <img src="img/HypotheticalMenu.png" alt="Hypothetical Dynamic GUI">
          <div class="fig">Dynamic Buttons: Choose Your Location!</div>
        </div>

        <p>To avoid clouding the problem with buttons and server communication, let's imagine a list of dynamically created
        functions that each print out a different number:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
def create_dynamic_callbacks():
    button_callbacks = list() # Create a list for our callbacks
    for num in range(10): # Loop through the numbers 0 to 9
        # Create a new function for each iteration of the loop
        def new_callback():
            return num
        
        # Append the new function to the list of callbacks 
        button_callbacks.append(new_callback)

    # Try out all the callbacks to see if they work 
    # (we wouldn't do this in an actual program):
    for callback in button_callbacks:
        print callback()

create_dynamic_callbacks()</pre>
  
  <div id='ex2' class="alert alert-success alert-block">
    <h4 class="alert-heading">Exercise 2: Try it out!</h4>
    Copy the above code into a file and run it. Is the result what you expect? 
  </div>

      <p>While we might imagine that the program above should print out the numbers from 0 through 9, that assumption is clearly false.
      WHAT? You might ask. Is Python broken? Has my whole life been a lie?</p>

      <p>Before you throw down your keyboard in disgust, I can assure you that Python is behaving exactly as it should. 
      Let's get a better handle on what's going on by testing out some theories.</p>

      <h3>Theory One <small>Many Copies of the Same Function?</small></h3>
      <p>Is the <code>new_callback</code> function only getting created once?</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">

        def new_callback():
            return num

<pre class="prettyprint well">

</pre>

      <p>Nope. If you understood <a href='#ex1'>Exercise 1</a>, you'll remember that different variables can both reference the same function object. 
      In this case, you can see that each function object has a different address; each function is different.</p>

      <h3>Theory Two <small>The value of <em>num</em>?</small></h3>
      <p>Is <code>num</code> actually assigned to each instance of the function?</p>

      <p>There we have it. In Python, variables in function objects don't get evaluated when the function is <em>created</em>; they get evaluated
      when the function is <em>called</em>. This is a powerful aspect of Python as a dynamic language, but it really isn't what we want in 
      this case.</p>

      <h2>Binding Variables to Functions <small>Taming Dynamic Callbacks</small></h2>
      <p>The problem with the dynamic function creation code we have been dealing with is one of <em>variable scope</em>.
      The <code>num</code> variable is local to the <code>create_dynamic_callbacks</code> function but one level above all of the 
      <code>new_callback</code> functions.</p>
      
      <p>We want a new local number variable to be created every time we create a new function. Since variables are evaluated the moment functions
      are called, we can solve our problem by calling a function to make our function:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
def create_dynamic_callbacks():
    button_callbacks = list() # Create a list for our callbacks
    for num in range(10): # Loop through the numbers 0 to 9
        # Create a function to return a function with a local num variable 
        def new_callback_creator(local_num):
            def new_callback():
                return local_num
            return new_callback
        
        # Create a new function with a local copy of num
        callback = new_callback_creator(num)

        # Append the new function to the list of callbacks         
        button_callbacks.append(callback)

    # Try out all the callbacks to see if they work 
    # (we wouldn't do this in an actual program):
    for callback in button_callbacks:
        print callback()

      <p>Yo dawg, I heard you like functions, so I put a function in your function to create a new function every time you loop. 
      It ain't pretty, but it gets the job done. Now we can create buttons with dynamic callbacks. Hooray!</p>

      <h2>Asynchronous Callbacks in Javascript <small>Concurrency with Style</small></h2>

      <p>While creating functions for buttons is one possible usecase, callbacks are also really useful for something called
      <em>asynchronous programming</em>. At the beginning of this tutorial, I talked about the importance of GUIs for your
      applications. The most important aspect of GUI development is interactivity. If you happen to perform a long operation
      while your program is running, you might block the user from performing any actions while that operation is happening.</p>

      <p>This is <strong>A Very Bad Thing&trade;</strong>, and you should never do it. Blocking operations are anathema to interactivity
      and will make users yell at you with righteous anger, as they should.</p>

      <p>"But I need to do <strong>Cool Things&trade;</strong> in my program," you say. "<strong>Cool Things&trade;</strong> take a long time.
      Whatever shall I do?"</p>

      <p>Never fear: with the magic of asynchronous programming, you can perform operations <em>in the background</em>, while the
      user is interacting with the interface. Let's switch languages for a moment and examine how asynchronous programming is used
      to perform background operations in the <a href="https://github.com/ohack/maraudersmap-ui">Marauder's Map@Olin Web Application</a>.</p>

      <p>JavaScript behaves similarly to Python when it comes to callbacks, but it also allows you to create multi-line <em>anonymous functions</em>,
      while Python restricts us to single-line <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-forms">lambda expressions</a> when we
      want to create nameless functions.

      <p>When you launch the Marauder's Map Web application, it refreshes every user's position and then starts a function to refresh the position of
      every user again every second: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
$(function () { // Once the webpage has loaded
  ...
  var visibleUsers = {}; // Will keep track of users and their positions
  ...
  var imgWidth;
  var imgHeight;
  $('#map-img').on('load', function () { // Once the image has loaded
                   // Get the dimensions of the image
                   imgWidth = $('#map-img').width(); 
                   imgHeight = $('#map-img').height();
                   updateUsers(visibleUsers, imgWidth, imgHeight, function () { // Once the update function has finished
                               setInterval(function() { // Every second (1000 milliseconds)
                                           // Update user positions
                                           updateUsers(visibleUsers, imgWidth, imgHeight, function () {} // Do nothing on completion
                                           )}, 1000);
                               });
                   });
  ...
});
</pre>

      <p>This excerpt from the Marauder's Map@Olin illustrates multiple uses for callbacks. The first line defines an anonymous function
      to execute when the webpage loads, and line 7 begins the definition for an anonymous function that will be executed when a 
      page element with the <code>id</code> <code>map-img</code> has loaded. Both functions are callbacks that are called when an operation
      is complete. Similarly, line 11 launches a function that runs a callback when it is finished. However, the <code>setInterval</code>
      function on the next line is different. While it is still connected to a callback, it runs it every second.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>updateUsers</code> function is an asynchronous function, which means that the rest of the 
        program can continue executing before the function is finished. Additionally, if it takes longer than a second to
        execute, it may be running at the same time as another instance of itself!
      </div>

      <p>Let's take a closer look at the <code>updateUsers</code> function to see why it is asynchronous:</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
function updateUsers(usersObject, boundsWidth, boundsHeight, cb) {
                     var newUsers = {};
                     // Request user positions from the server asynchronously
                     Api.getPositions(true, function (err, json) {
                                      var extendedPositions = json.positions;
                                      // Loop through all user positions and update the users
                                      for (var i=0; i &lt; extendedPositions.length; i++) {
                                        associatePositionMarkerWithBind(usersObject, extendedPositions[i], boundsWidth, boundsHeight);
                                        newUsers[extendedPositions[i].username] = true;
                                      }
                                      
                                       for (var uname in usersObject) {
                                         ... 
                                          /* Delete the markers of users who should no longer be on the map because
                                             the server didn't tell us their positions.*/
                                          if (newUsers[uname] != true) {
                                              delete usersObject[uname]; 
                                              ...
                                          }
                                         ...
                                       }

                                      cb(); // Execute the callback once users have been updated
                       
                     });
}
</pre>

      <p>The specifics of how the <code>updateUsers</code> function works aren't important for our purposes; let's focus on line 
      4, which defines an asynchronous server request. Since the remainder of the function is encapsulated in an another anonymous
      callback, the function won't do anything until the server responds. Meanwhile, anything after a call to <code>updateUsers</code>
      can execute before the function has finished executing. In the example below, "Hello," will probably be logged before "Olin":
      </p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
updateUsers({}, 100, 100, function () {
  console.log("Olin");  
});
console.log("Hello,");
</pre>

      <p>Why is this important? It means that any interactive code placed after the function can continue to run while long server
      operations are happening, and the user won't get frustrated by the application appearing to freeze. It also means that we have to 
      be very careful when we are designing algorithms that use data generated by the function.</p>

      <p>To demonstrate the importance of this, let's pretend that the braces in <code>updateUsers</code> were moved around slightly:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums well">
function updateUsers(usersObject, boundsWidth, boundsHeight, cb) {
                     var newUsers = {};
                     // Request user positions from the server asynchronously
                     Api.getPositions(true, function (err, json) {
                                      var extendedPositions = json.positions;
                                      // Loop through all user positions and update the users
                                      for (var i=0; i &lt; extendedPositions.length; i++) {
                                        associatePositionMarkerWithBind(usersObject, extendedPositions[i], boundsWidth, boundsHeight);
                                        newUsers[extendedPositions[i].username] = true;
                                      }
                     <span class="code-insertion">});</span> 

                     for (var uname in usersObject) {
                       ... 
                        /* Delete the markers of users who should no longer be on the map because
                           the server didn't tell us their positions.*/
                        if (newUsers[uname] != true) {
                            delete usersObject[uname]; 
                            ...
                        }
                       ...
                     }

                     cb(); // Execute the callback once users have been updated
              
                     <span class="code-deletion">});</span>
}
</pre>

    <p>Since <code>Api.getPositions</code> will not execute its callback until the server sends a response, <code>usersObject</code> and
    <code>newUsers</code> will not have been modified by lines 8 and 9 before the <code>for</code> loop deletes every user on the map.
    Oh noes!</p>

    <p>Use asynchronous programming wisely.</p>
